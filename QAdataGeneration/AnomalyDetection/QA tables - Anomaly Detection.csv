ad_60,Factual,Under delivery,Were there periods when insulin delivery was lower than the controller indicated?,Periods with data labelled with: unknown_under,"{[event_start, event_end], ...} if any, or {}",Interval Event,Inject negative biased basals and unknown under-delivered basals,Affinity F-score,,"Identify periods when insulin delivery appears normal based on controller reports but the actual delivery is consistently lower than indicated, as evidenced by reduced physiological effects or adjustments in the patient's blood glucose levels. These discrepancies suggest times when actual insulin delivery was less than intended or recorded."
ad_61,Factual,Under delivery,"Was there any time when it seemed like I was getting insulin normally, but the actual amount was less than what it was supposed to be?",Periods with data labelled with: unknow_under,"{[event_start, event_end], ...} if any, or {}",Interval Event,Inject unknown under delivered basal,Affinity F-score,,"Identify periods when insulin delivery appears normal based on controller reports but the actual delivery is consistently lower than indicated, as evidenced by reduced physiological effects or adjustments in the patient's blood glucose levels. These discrepancies suggest times when actual insulin delivery was less than intended or recorded."
ad_62,Knowledge,Stop delivery,Were there any periods when the insulin reservoir appeared empty?,Periods with data labelled with: unknow_stop,"{[event_start, event_end], ...} if any, or {}",Interval Event,Inject unknown stopped basal,Affinity F-score,,"Identify periods where insulin delivery appears to continue normally in reported data, but there is no corresponding effect on glucose levels, suggesting a complete lack of actual insulin administration. These patterns may indicate times when the insulin reservoir was empty, leading to unintentional missed delivery despite normal controller behavior."
ad_63,Knowledge,Stop delivery,Were there any periods when my infusion set seemed to have gotten blocked or kinked?,Periods with data labelled with: unknow_stop,"{[event_start, event_end], ...} if any, or {}",Interval Event,Inject unknown stopped basal,Affinity F-score,,"Identify periods where reported insulin delivery appears normal, but glucose levels do not respond as expected, indicating no actual insulin effect. These discrepancies may suggest that the infusion set was blocked or kinked, preventing insulin from reaching the body despite proper system operation."
ad_64,Knowledge,Under delivery,Was there any period when insulin might have leaked out or didn’t get absorbed like it normally does?,Periods with data labelled with: unknow_under,"{[event_start, event_end], ...} if any, or {}",Interval Event,Inject unknown under delivered basal,Affinity F-score,,"Identify periods where insulin delivery appears normal, but glucose levels do not decrease as expected, indicating reduced effectiveness. These patterns may suggest that insulin leaked out or was not properly absorbed, resulting in lower than anticipated impact on glucose despite standard delivery behavior."
